# Michelson-Interferometer-Simulation
Three different simulations of the light pattern of the **Michelson Interferometer**.

To try the simulations just copy the code to your favorite Python notebook and run the code.
The first and the second simulation are provided with a slider to see how the pattern changes while modifying the distance between mirrors.
