# Michelson-Interferometer-Simulation
Three different simulations of the light pattern of the **Michelson Interferometer**.

To use it just copy the code to your favorite Python notebook and run the code.
The first and the second simulation are provided with a slider to see how the pattern change while modifying the distance between mirrors.

Developed in an internship with [ICFO](https://icfo.eu).
